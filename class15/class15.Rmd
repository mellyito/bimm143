## RNA-Seq analysis

The data for our hands-on session comes from GEO entry: GSE37704, which is associated with the following publication:

> Trapnell C, Hendrickson DG, Sauvageau M, Goff L et al. Differential analysis of gene regulation at transcript resolution with RNA-seq. Nat Biotechnol 2013 Jan;31(1):46-53. PMID: 23222703

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)
```

```{r}
# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

Hmm...looks like we need to remove the first "length" column in the `countData` object.


```{r}
# remove first col from countData
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```

Let's remove the rows with zero counts in all experiments(i.e. columns)

```{r}
nonzero.rows <- (rowSums(countData) != 0)
```

```{r}
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
countData = countData[nonzero.rows, ]
head(countData)
```

```{r}
nrow(countData)
```

## Running DESeq2
Nice now lets setup the DESeqDataSet object required for the DESeq() function and then run the DESeq pipeline. This is again similar to our last days hands-on session.

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```

Get our results.
```{r}
res <- results(dds)
summary(res)
```

Now we will make a volcano plot, a commonly produced visualization from this type of data that we introduced last day. Basically it's a plot of log2 fold change vs -log adjusted p-value.

```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
abline(v=c(-2,2), col = "green", lty=2, lwd=2)
abline(h=-log(0.01), col = "green", lty=2, lwd=2)

# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col= mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```

## Add annotation
Since we mapped and counted against the Ensembl annotation, our results only have information about Ensembl gene IDs. However, our pathway analysis downstream will use KEGG pathways, and genes in KEGG pathways are annotated with Entrez gene IDs. So lets add them as we did the last day.

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

```{r}
res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(as.data.frame(res))
```

Write our our ordered and annotated results object.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

Time estimate 11am


## Section 2.

```{r}
# Install packages in CONSOLE
# Run in your R console (i.e. not your Rmarkdown doc!)
# BiocManager::install( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)
```

```{r}
data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in res$entrez).
And we have the fold change results from DESeq2 analysis (stored in res$log2FoldChange).

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Run the **gage()** functions with this input

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
head(keggres)
```

Now lets look at the object returned from gage().
```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)
```

Now, let's try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color.

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

```{r}
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
